I am a mobile developer focused on iOS applications and RESTful APIs. Most recently, I have had work showcased at the last 3 iOS keynotes as well as at WWDC 2012 while working for [OpenTable](http://www.aribraginsky.com/portfolio/noflash/?page_id=1199) on their consumer iOS team. Currently into Swift, WatchKit, HomeKit, iBeacons and HealthKit among other things.  I also have development experience with Java EE, .NET, LAMP and Flash.

### More Information

For more than a decade I have developed e-commerce, social media, web and intranet applications as well as games for clients that have included OpenTable, TopTable, the San Francisco Chronicle/SFGate, Cumulus Media, CBS, WABC, Lin Media, Orbitz, Sony, Callaway, Chicago Field Museum, Energy BBDO, Venables Bell & Partners, Conagra Foods, Mekanism, Publicis Groupe, Leo Burnett USA, Saatchi-Saatchi, Kelloggs, Heidelberg, Samsung and more.

I frequently tweet about iOS and unrelated topics as [@lemonkey](http://twitter.com/lemonkey) and participate in San Francisco bay area [meet-ups](http://www.meetup.com/members/9419422/) for iOS and other related technologies.

Besides software development, I love to recharge other areas of my brain by building furniture, designing and developing Arduino projects focused on home automation, cycling, taking care of the local wildlife and watching films.
